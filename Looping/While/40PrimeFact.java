/*Q40. Write a java program to find all prime factors of a number.
The prime factors of a number are all the prime numbers that, when multiplied together, result in the original number. 
A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that has only two divisors: 1 and the number itself. 
For example:
The prime factors of 12 are 2 and 3, because 2 x 2 x 3 = 12. 
The prime factors of 20 are 2 and 5, because 2 x 2 x 5 = 20. 
The prime factors of 30 are 2, 3, and 5, because 2 x 3 x 5 = 30.
