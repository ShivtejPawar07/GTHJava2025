/*Q49. Write a Java program to display all Carmichael Numbers up to n.
 A Carmichael number is a composite number n which satisfies Fermat’s little theorem for every integer that is relatively prime to n. (Tip: For practice, find numbers like 561, 1105, 1729 up to n.)
Explanation:
 Use a loop to check if the number is composite, then test Fermat’s condition for integers a from 2 to n-1 that are coprime to n. Use only loops; no built-in GCD or power functions.
